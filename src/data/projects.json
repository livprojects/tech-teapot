Two quizzes are available for now: for each question, you can choose how many answers you want to click on. There is a confirmation step: green is the right answer, red is a wrong one. If you didn't select the right answer, the quiz won't tell you which it was: it is on purpose. You can click on any of the answers but there is a clue stating how many answers are expected. You get the results at the end of each quiz.",
